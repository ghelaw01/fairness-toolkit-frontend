# AI Fairness Toolkit - Compliance Guide

**Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Overview

This guide explains how the AI Fairness Toolkit helps organizations comply with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, and adhere to ethical AI principles.

## 2. GDPR Compliance

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires data protection by design and by default. Our toolkit supports this through:

-   **Data Minimization:** The toolkit processes only the data required for analysis.
-   **Anonymization & Pseudonymization:**
    -   **Anonymization:** Generalizes data to prevent re-identification.
    -   **Pseudonymization:** Replaces sensitive data with irreversible hashes.
-   **Right to Explanation:** LIME and counterfactual explanations help fulfill the right to a meaningful explanation of automated decisions.
-   **Audit Trails:** Comprehensive logging provides a record of all analyses for accountability.

## 3. HIPAA Compliance

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) governs the use of Protected Health Information (PHI). Our toolkit supports HIPAA compliance by:

-   **Secure Data Handling:** The toolkit does not store uploaded data long-term. All processing is done in memory.
-   **De-identification:** Anonymization and pseudonymization features help de-identify PHI before analysis.
-   **Access Controls:** The toolkit can be deployed in a secure environment with access controls to restrict who can perform analyses.
-   **Audit Logs:** All analyses are logged, providing an audit trail for compliance checks.

## 4. Ethical AI Principles

Our toolkit is designed around key ethical AI principles:

-   **Fairness:** The core purpose of the toolkit is to detect, understand, and mitigate bias.
-   **Transparency:** Explainability features provide insight into model behavior. All metrics are clearly documented.
-   **Accountability:** Audit logs and reporting provide a clear record of all fairness assessments.
-   **Privacy:** Data protection features are built-in to protect sensitive information.

## 5. Recommended Practices

1.  **Anonymize Data:** Always anonymize or pseudonymize sensitive data before uploading it to the toolkit.
2.  **Regular Audits:** Use the audit trail to regularly review who is performing fairness analyses and on what data.
3.  **Document Everything:** Use the reporting feature to document all fairness assessments and mitigation efforts.
4.  **Stay Updated:** Keep the toolkit and its dependencies updated to ensure you have the latest security and privacy features.
